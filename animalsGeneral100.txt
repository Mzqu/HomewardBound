me inside because I insist on enjoying the outdoors. &nbsp;I do have a bad habit and must be honest. &nbsp;I mark in the house. &nbsp;But if you put a belly band on me then it will save your sanity. &nbsp;PS- you can see me sporting the latest in male fashion accessories (ie- the belly band) in some of my photos.<br \/><br \/>I am current on all my shots and heartworm negative. &nbsp;I am ok with other dogs but I should not be around children. &nbsp;Due to my life prior to my original rescue in 2006, something bad must have happened and I can get snarly and ungentlemanly. &nbsp;So it would be best for all if I not be around children of any age.<br \/><br \/>My foster mommy lives in Rockford, IL and has restricted my adoption radius to within a 90 min drive from her. &nbsp;She needs to show you how to handle me and some do's &amp; don't's around me.

abused Eskies from humane societies, pounds, shelters, or from owners who need to find a new home for their Eskies. We are ALWAYS in need of foster homes for these dogs until they can be adopted. It's vacation season and people are leaving town- and dumping their dogs!! We're desperate for foster homes-- help!! <br \/><br \/>The primary role of the foster home is to evaluate the new Eskie as to health, behavior and temperament, as follows:<br \/><br \/>HEALTH<br \/>Determine what medical needs the Eskie has, such as routine vaccinations, heartworm tests (and heartworm treatment, if necessary), being spayed\/neutered, having their teeth cleaned, etc. In the case of our more severely abused or neglected dogs, the foster home ensures that the dog gets the medical attention required to get him\/her back to optimal health. <br \/><br \/>BEHAVIOR AND TEMPERAMENT<br \/>1. Evaluate the dog for behavioral issues and work to correct any undesirable traits exhibited by the dog. These may include not being housebroken, needing basic obedience training (including learning to walk on a leash), excessive barking, etc. <br \/><br \/>2. Evaluate the dog's temperament: is he\/she friendly, aggressive, shy, scared, submissive? How does the dog get along with other dogs, cats, children, men, women, strangers, and so on? The foster home will then be responsible for providing the proper training and socialization needed to make the dog adoptable.<br \/><br \/>After the assessment and vetting of the dog, the foster home provides ERU with bio information and pictures, so the dog can be posted on ERU's website and on Petfinder.com. Sometimes our foster homes also participate in adoption events that provide additional exposure both to the foster dog and to Eskie Rescuers United.<br \/><br \/>ERU pays for the cost of all vetting and medical needs of our foster dogs, including heartworm and flea\/tick medications. The foster home provides for the dog's food, treats and toys and is not reimbursed for those expenses by ERU. <br \/><br \/>Fostering a rescue dog can be a lot of work and responsibility. Some of these dogs were never provided proper socialization or medical care, and therefore are not perfectly behaved or impeccably groomed. MANY of our fosters come from deplorable situations and may need a lot of tender loving care to get them cleaned up, be taught how to trust again, or just simply realize what it's like to be loved and cherished! <br \/><br \/>Before applying to become a new foster home, please ask yourself (and your family members) if you have enough time and patience, as well as the understanding of the Eskie breed, to care properly for a rescue dog. Fostering can be an incredibly rewarding labor of love, and you can make all the difference in the world to the dog(s) you foster. <br \/><br \/>If you are interested in fostering an Eskie, please go to: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eskierescuers.org\/\">our website, www.eskierescuers.org<\/a> and sign-in and complete a foster application.

She is friendly and playful. She is also sweet and independent...and just a little bit sassy! Ruby does great with cat-friendly dogs, but probably needs to be the only cat in the household. <br \/><br \/>Ruby loves being around people and always wants to be where the action is. She follows her foster mom around everywhere. When she hears the door-bell ring, she runs to the door to greet whoever is there. Ruby is a very polite and well-behaved kitty who always uses her scratching posts and never jumps on the kitchen counter. Her favorite past-time is being brushed, which she loves even more than her treats. And speaking of treats, she is probably the only cat you'll find who stands up on her back legs to beg for treats!<br \/><br \/>Ruby is very playful and makes anything she can swat into a toy. She loves chasing a tennis ball - even though it belongs to her canine friend, Cassie! It took Ruby a little while to get use to Cassie, but now her favorite pass-time is waiting around corners and pouncing in front of Cassie when she walks by. Ruby adapts to various situations easily, from workmen fixing the floors, ambulances driving by, overnight guests, or vocal Superbowl parties. <br \/>Ruby will make a wonderful companion to a lucky person or family with older kids who can give this great kitty a forever home!<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Please be sure to visit our website (<\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.spcanova.org\/adoption\/catlist.php\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">http:\/\/www.spcanova.org\/adoption\/catlist.php<\/span><\/span><\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">) for details about our adoption policies.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?1498774&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div><div class=\"rgFooter\"><br><p>PLEASE NOTE: WE ADOPT TO RESIDENTS OF NORTHERN VA AND WASHINGTON DC SUBURBS ONLY.

style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\">The year 2005 was special for FFGW: it was our 10th anniversary year and, among many others, we rescued a very pregnant calico who had 4 beautiful kittens just hours after arriving in foster care. Melody was adopted with one of her kittens (Josie), but sadly, through no fault of her own, has come back to FFGW. Stunningly pretty, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\">Melody is a dilute calico, with a snow-white chest and paws, a classic calico &ldquo;mask,&rdquo; and a bright pink nose.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\">Melody is shy, and while not always a lap cat, she will cuddle right up to you when you&#39;re sleeping, or sit next to you on the couch. In time, with one special person to adore,&nbsp;Melody will reward your patience with incredible love-- all the sweeter for having been earned&mdash;and blossom like a flower.

Melody was adopted with one of her kittens (Josie), but sadly, through no fault of her own, has come back to FFGW. Stunningly pretty, Melody is a dilute calico, with a snow-white chest and paws, a classic calico &ldquo;mask,&rdquo; and a bright pink nose.&nbsp;Melody is shy, and while not always a lap cat, she will cuddle right up to you when you&#39;re sleeping, or sit next to you on the couch. In time, with one special person to adore,&nbsp;Melody will reward your patience with incredible love-- all the sweeter for having been earned&mdash;and blossom like a flower.

She walks great on a leash.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nMinnie's puppy, Moe, was adopted some time ago. Now Minnie is hoping it's her turn. Minnie is a terrific girl who is good with dogs near her size. Minnie is not good with cats or small dogs or small children. Minnie is a happy girl who is pretty calm ready to become a great family dog for a very lucky family!&nbsp; \r\n\r\nMinnie needs a loving forever home to lavish love and attention on her. Please open your heart and home to Minnie!&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLike most shelter dogs, Minnie may need a refresher on house training.\r\nPotential adopters must agree to continue mandatory training with a certified K9 behaviorist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee for this dog is $300 which includes the cost of heartworm treatment and routine vetting, including vaccinations and spay\/neuter.\r\nIf you are interested in adopting, please download our&nbsp;Adoption Questionnaire&nbsp;and email it to info@dogsxlrescue.org or fill out the application online at

been placed on a daily dose of Prednisone and a monthly injection of B-12. &nbsp;Vivi will receive these for the rest of her life.&nbsp; She continues with the twice daily enzymes for EPI as well as a restricted diet for the IBD. &nbsp;Due to the recent diagnosis, Vivi needs to avoid stressful situations, including rescue events.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of her medical needs, Vivi remains a sweet and loving dog&nbsp;who is happy to see her people each day and play with her fur-siblings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4\/28\/16 Update: I guess I spoke too soon.....Vivi suffered a severe flare-up of her IBD and needed short-term hospitalization. &nbsp;It seems Vivi ate too much grass, causing inflammation in her gut thus triggering the flare-up of the IBD. &nbsp; She&#39;s doing better now, the meds and prescription diet are kicking in, sSe&#39;ll be back to her happy self in no time!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3\/4\/16 Update: &nbsp; Vivi continues to do well. &nbsp;She still requires enzymes with each meal, and meds must be kept on hand in the event of a &quot;flare-up&quot; (diarrhea), or she goes too long without eating. &nbsp;She can be a little temperamental when it comes to eating, sometimes requiring finding the right room in which to eat. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>9\/2 Update: &nbsp;Aviva - (Vivi), is&nbsp;a wonderful member of her foster&#39;s&nbsp;family! &nbsp;She LOVES the toy basket and will root around for just the right toy for the moment. &nbsp;Sometimes something fuzzy and squeaky, sometimes hard and chewable. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aviva enjoys lounging in the house with her fur-siblings, or on the not-so-hot days resting beneath a large forsythia in the backyard......she&#39;s dug herself a nice hole in the ground perfect for an afternoon nap! &nbsp; Mention the word &quot;walk&quot; and Vivi will race you to the door and wonder why it&#39;s taking so long to get her leash on her! &nbsp;She loves the neighbors, big and small, and happily greets those along our path.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivi still needs close monitoring of her food intake&nbsp;(and output) and continues on the daily enzyme supplement&nbsp;to treat her EPI. &nbsp;And if she does happen to go too long without eating, she is given an appetite stimulant.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To read some of Aviva&#39;s past updates check out her page <a

personality. &nbsp;CoCo has a detached retina and cataract in her left&nbsp;eye, but her other eye is perfect (except for being dry, which is treated with drops). &nbsp;The eye vet does not expect that CoCo&#39;s&nbsp;right eye will&nbsp;develop a cataract. &nbsp;CoCo now sees the eye vet every 6 months.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to find out more about CoCo, please email her foster mom.","animalDistinguishingMarks":"","animalEarType":"","animalEnergyLevel":"","animalExerciseNeeds":"Moderate","animalEyeColor":"","animalFence":"Not

class=\"rgDescription\">Hi,<br \/><br \/>\r\n<p>I'm Max. I am a neutered male just over 8yrs. old. Don't let the age discourage ya, I'm a very young and vivacious 8. I act like most 2 yr. olds.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am settling in very well into the foster home.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been in my foster home for almost a year now,&nbsp; and I am looking for a forever home.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am very affectionate and really like just laying on the couch beside you. Matter of fact I prefer to follow you from room to room cuz at times I don&rsquo;t want to be alone without you. &nbsp;Then there are the times when I am perfectly content taking a nap on the bed without you. I also have a very sensitive and needy side that comes out sometimes.&nbsp; I got to go on a walk yesterday on something called a \"leash\", and I walked very well and practiced good manners. &nbsp;In my past life I was never really taught basic obedience, therefore, I am starting on the basics. Sometimes I hear foster mom on the phone and so I listen to find out if she is talking about me, and most times she is talking about me. She says to people that during the time I have lived with her I have &ldquo;evolved&rdquo;. That I have come a long way and changed a lot compared to the dog who walked through her door 11 months ago. I know I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of obedience and &ldquo;excelled&rdquo; in commands and training. I am eager to learn, because it gets me one on one attention. Oh yeah here&rsquo;s something else, I used to shudder at the thought of going bye bye in the car. I would sit on her lap and shake. Not no more, personally now if you want my opinion, I don&rsquo;t get to go in the car enough. Apparently it has something to do with summertime heat temperatures. Like &ldquo;whatever &ldquo;, just let me know when we can go again!<\/p>\r\n<p>Something else that I recently got to do for the first time was to ride on something called a quadrunner, you may call it an ATV.&nbsp; I even got my picture taken sitting on it.

I am a neutered male just over 8yrs. old. Don't let the age discourage ya, I'm a very young and vivacious 8. I act like most 2 yr. olds.\r\nI am settling in very well into the foster home.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been in my foster home for almost a year now,&nbsp; and I am looking for a forever home.\r\nI am very affectionate and really like just laying on the couch beside you. Matter of fact I prefer to follow you from room to room cuz at times I don&rsquo;t want to be alone without you. &nbsp;Then there are the times when I am perfectly content taking a nap on the bed without you. I also have a very sensitive and needy side that comes out sometimes.&nbsp; I got to go on a walk yesterday on something called a \"leash\", and I walked very well and practiced good manners. &nbsp;In my past life I was never really taught basic obedience, therefore, I am starting on the basics. Sometimes I hear foster mom on the phone and so I listen to find out if she is talking about me, and most times she is talking about me. She says to people that during the time I have lived with her I have &ldquo;evolved&rdquo;. That I have come a long way and changed a lot compared to the dog who walked through her door 11 months ago. I know I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of obedience and &ldquo;excelled&rdquo; in commands and training. I am eager to learn, because it gets me one on one attention. Oh yeah here&rsquo;s something else, I used to shudder at the thought of going bye bye in the car. I would sit on her lap and shake. Not no more, personally now if you want my opinion, I don&rsquo;t get to go in the car enough. Apparently it has something to do with summertime heat temperatures. Like &ldquo;whatever &ldquo;, just let me know when we can go again!\r\nSomething else that I recently got to do for the first time was to ride on something called a quadrunner, you may call it an ATV.&nbsp; I even got my picture taken sitting on it. The pic&rsquo;s are posted below.&nbsp; That was cool; &nbsp;The air was in my face and it felt good. I hope to do it again soon. &nbsp;\r\nIn the past I had never experienced living with other animals. I live with multiple animals, cats and&nbsp; dogs. That was a huge challenge and continues to be a challenge, but guess what. &nbsp;I heard her talking on the phone again and she said that I have made a lot of progress.

and I love life. They say I never have a bad day but I just believe you need to live life to the fullest and with lots of gusto. My foster mama says I have the best smile and give the best hugs and kisses. Some may say I need a job, but foster mom says I need a home that will tire my brain and my body.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, I am an active girl who likes to learn and do things, really I am no couch potato.Swimming is my favorite hobby, along with chasing my ball, and hiking. I have done some really fun things like a rally competition, dock diving practice, and scent work. My foster sister would tell you that she loves me and loves to play with me but I sometimes forget she gets tired.

They say I never have a bad day but I just believe you need to live life to the fullest and with lots of gusto. My foster mama says I have the best smile and give the best hugs and kisses. Some may say I need a job, but foster mom says I need a home that will tire my brain and my body.\r\n\r\nSo, I am an active girl who likes to learn and do things, really I am no couch potato.Swimming is my favorite hobby, along with chasing my ball, and hiking. I have done some really fun things like a rally competition, dock diving practice, and scent work. My foster sister would tell you that she loves me and loves to play with me but I sometimes forget she gets tired.

Whether it's out in public, a dog park or a doggy daycare he loves all dogs. Sometimes he needs a slow introduction to puppies because he is practically still a puppy himself but doesn't understand that his size and demeanor can be scary to the little ones! Most of the time after an introduction, he plays great with them (puppies). He enjoys walks, jogs, hikes, swimming, chasing soccer balls and playing in the snow!

He takes some getting used to due to his big size and even bigger personality. If any one can&#39;t have a dog and wants the next best thing, then George is the cat for you. He knows sit, he knows stay and he definitely knows beg. He needs to be an only cat, or only one other house mate, since he did not grow up with other cats or dogs and takes a while to get used to them. He is good with cat friendly dogs. But can be a bit rough for kids so he would be best with older kids only. A few months ago he presented with symptoms of lameness in several of his feet with ulcers forming on the bottoms of his pads. We took him to Crofton Veterinary Center where he was examined and put on medications. His ulcers have healed, his pads look great and he is back to his old self! Except the few pounds his diet has helped him lose. It seems he had a uncommon condition called &quot;plasma cell pododermatitis&quot;.

about 17 lbs. &nbsp;He&#39;s being tested for allergies right now, We are currently waiting on his test results. &nbsp;He&#39;s had a rough life. &nbsp;I found him wandering a local highway in the freezing rain, filthy dirty, shivering, and crying. &nbsp;He was flea infested, &nbsp;had hardly any hair on his bottom half. &nbsp;He was suffering from flea bite allergy and had scabs, and open sores. &nbsp;He was extremely itchy and would cry because it hurt so much. &nbsp;He was hesitant at first but it took very little coaxing before he came to me. &nbsp;I wrapped him in a blanket and as soon as we were in my car he kissed my face. &nbsp;He sat on my lap all the way home. This poor guy has 3 herniated disks, 3 BB gun pellets (he was shot), a tail that was traumatized somehow, some weakness in his hind legs (caused by the disks), a bluish haze over his eyes which the vet says is comparable to humans needing reading glasses, and plenty of bumps and lumps (which the vet believes is of no concern.) &nbsp;He needs a loving home where someone is willing to give him the life he deserves. &nbsp;He&#39;s super sweet, but like his nickname, can be a grumpy old man. &nbsp;He&#39;s got the funniest personality! &nbsp;He makes all sorts of funny sounds when he&#39;s playing, and his nose works for sure! &nbsp;We call it his super sniffer! &nbsp;He&#39;s a great cuddler, loves walks, toys, and treats. He does well during bath time, and he&#39;s well behaved in the car. &nbsp;He does well at the vet, and the groomer too. He&#39;s excellent in the house, no accidents. &nbsp;Also, he doesn&#39;t need a crate, he&#39;s very good! &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t get into anything or chew stuff up. He sleeps with us too! &nbsp;(Watch out, he snores!) He&#39;s completely spoiled. &nbsp;We love him and know that whomever adopts this little guy will love him too! &nbsp;He&#39;s great with woman, a bit slow to warm up to men, but he does come around. &nbsp;Kids are ok as long as there is no rough housing. &nbsp;It seems to make him nervous. &nbsp;He&#39;s not a fan of lots of action (like running) he&#39;s a quiet peaceful kinda guy. &nbsp;Buddy and Maya (my dog) get along ok. &nbsp;They don&#39;t play together very often, mostly they just co-exist. &nbsp;Sometimes they lay in my bed together, or next to each other on the floor. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t like when she sniffs at him, mostly because of his tender tail. &nbsp;He has attached himself to me pretty good. &nbsp;If anyone playfully hits me, or anything like that, he will bark and growl. &nbsp;He also growls at Maya if he is laying in my lap and she comes over to visit, but, if she&#39;s by me before him it&#39;s not a problem. &nbsp;I know that&#39;s a lot to consider when thinking about adopting a dog, but honestly, he has given me more then I could ever give him. &nbsp;He&#39;s just a joy to have.
